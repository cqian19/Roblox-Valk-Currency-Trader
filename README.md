# Roblox Valk Trade Currency Bot  <image height=45 width=45 src=./images/bot_icon.png>
Valk TC Bot is a new, fully-functional trade currency bot for ROBLOX built with an intuitive GUI using [PySide](https://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/index.html).

## Features
 - Full GUI interface with customizable settings that save every time you open it! 
 - Real-time GUI trade log. See what the bot is doing!
 - Competes with other bots.
 - Able to trade both currencies at the same time (Most bots trade only one currency at a time).
 - Fast, accurate trading to avoid losing money.
 - Login and trade from the GUI. No browser needs to be opened.
 
## Download
Download the installer(.msi) from here: [Latest Release][current_download]  ![Version][release-img]

After installation, a shortcut will appear on your desktop. Run it to start the bot!

## Guide
1. The first screen is a login screen. A successful ROBLOX login will lead to the second screen with the bot settings.
2. Enter the amount of tickets/robux to trade, OR check the "Trade all" checkbox (RECOMMENDED).
3. Press the "Start" button to begin the bot, and "Stop" to finish.

## Settings
 - **Amount:** Sets the maximum amount of tix/robux for the bot to trade. The bot will not always trade at this amount for accuracy, but it will trade close to the amount. WARNING: The bot will NOT trade if you have less than the set amount. Use trade all to avoid this.
 - **Trade all:** Trades all of your current tix/robux. This works best since after trading, you may end up with less of one currency than the set amount option, and the bot will not trade. Recommended setting: ON
 - **Split trades:** Enables/disables split trades. A split trade allows people to exchange separately for the money you submit. Disabling this means the trade will only go through if someone trades the ENTIRE amount at once. Recommended setting: ON
