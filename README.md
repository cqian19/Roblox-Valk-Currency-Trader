## Disclaimer
This is NOT a keylogger/virus/etc. If you do not trust this bot, feel free to run an antivirus scan on it.   
Valk TC Bot for ROBLOX is still in beta. There may be bugs/issues. Please submit an issue if you encounter one.
## Download
Download the installer(.msi) from here: [Latest Release][current_download]   ![Version][release-img]  
Supports Windows.
## Features
 - Full GUI interface with customizable settings that save every time you open it! 
 - Real-time GUI trade log. See what the bot is doing!
 - Competes with other bots.
 - Able to trade both currencies at the same time (Most bots trade only one currency at a time).
 - Fast, accurate trading to avoid losing money.
 - Login and trade from the GUI. No browser needs to be opened.
 


After installation, a shortcut will appear on your desktop. Run it to start the bot!

## Guide
1. The first screen is a login screen. A successful ROBLOX login will lead to the second screen with the bot settings.
2. Enter the amount of tickets/robux to trade, OR check the "Trade all" checkbox (RECOMMENDED).
3. Press the "Start" button to begin the bot, and "Stop" to finish.

## Settings
 - **Amount:** Sets the maximum amount of tix/robux for the bot to trade. The bot will not always trade at this amount for accuracy, but it will trade close to the amount. 
 - **Trade all:** Trades all of your current tix/robux. This works best since after trading, you may end up with less of one currency than the set amount option, and the bot will not trade.  
Recommended setting: ON
 - **Split trades:** Enables/disables split trades. A split trade allows people to exchange separately for the money you submit. Disabling this means the trade will only go through if someone trades the ENTIRE amount at once.  
Recommended setting: ON

## Known Issues
1. **I: Double-clicking the shortcut isn't doing anything!**

    **A: Antivirus may be scanning/blocking the program. Disable antivirus and try again. If you do not trust this bot, run a scan on it.**


2. **I: The config isn't saving! (Errno 13)**
	
	**A: Run the bot as an administrator(Right-click the shortcut>Run as administrator)**
	
	
3. **I: The bot isn't trading!**

	**A: The bot is looking for a good rate to trade at. Be patient.**
